I'm a writer, so I spend most of my time with words â€” writing them, rewriting them, reading them, deleting them, et cetera.

I did a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Colorado, Boulder with the wonderful [Dan Larremore](http://danlarremore.com). I studied hierarchies in social systems, specifically prestige in academia, and competition in online dating. It was good fun.

I also like to climb and run, but am, alas, deeply averse to interesting conversation.
