I worked on this project with Brett Fischler, Daniel Griffin, and Tyler Lubeck for our senior capstone project with generous support, guidance, and advice from Professor Mai Vu (Tufts University).

We built an indoor positioning system using a customized k-nearest neighbor algorithm to match the RSS values observed at an unknown location to the RSS values of known (previously recorded) locations.

We presented this paper at PIMRC2015.
